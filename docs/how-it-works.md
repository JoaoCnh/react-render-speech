`react-speech` uses the Render Props pattern. If you do not know this pattern yet, do not worry, you can still use the package with ease.

If you want to know more about the pattern, please follow these links:

## SpeechRecognizer and SpeechSynthesis

This package comes with 2 components for your use.

The first, `SpeechRecognizer` allows you to turn voice into text using the [SpeechRecognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition).

The second, `SpeechSynthesis` allows you to turn text into synthesized voice using the [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis).

Let's see how they work in the [API Reference](./api-reference.md) section
